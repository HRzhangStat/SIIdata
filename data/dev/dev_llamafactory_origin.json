This means: if a cell is filled with water, all cells directly below it *within the same tank* must also be filled, down to the bottom of that tank.\n4.  **Clues:** The numbers outside the grid indicate how many cells *in total* must be filled with water in that specific row (numbers on the left) or column (numbers on the top).\n5.  **Solving:** Use the numbers as clues to figure out which cells must be filled with water, ensuring that the water level rule within each tank is followed, until all numbers are satisfied.\n\n\nYour task is to choose the correct grid configuration from the options below that represents the solution to the puzzle. Each cell is represented by 0 (empty) or 1 (water).\n\nOption A:\n```\n0 0 0 1 0 1\n0 0 0 0 0 1\n0 0 0 1 1 1\n0 0 0 1 0 1\n0 0 0 1 1 1\n0 0 0 1 1 1\n```\n\nOption B:\n```\n0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 0 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1 1 1\n0 0 0 0 1 1\n0 0 0 1 1 1\n0 0 0 1 1 1\n```\n\nOption C:\n```\n0 0 0 1 0 1\n0 0 0 1 0 1\n0 0 0 1 1 1\n0 0 0 1 1 1\n0 0 0 1 1 1\n0 0 0 1 1 1\n```\n\nOption D:\n```\n0 0 0 1 0 1\n0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 0 1 1 1\n0 0 0 1 1 1\n0 0 0 1 1 1\n0 0 0 1 1 0\n```\n\nPlease provide your answer as a single letter (A, B, C, or D) in \\boxed{} corresponding to the correct option."
